# meteor-showers

This project renders debris clouds in the solar system.  When the Earth passes through a cloud, we experience a meteor shower!

The project is online at: http://www.ianww.com/meteor-showers/.  It uses data from [NASA CAMS](http://cams.seti.org/), and was built with feedback from by project leader Peter Jenniskens.

This is a modified version of [Asterank](http://github.com/typpo/asterank)'s 3D code, which is another project of mine.
